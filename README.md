Currently, I serve as a Senior Researcher in NLP R&D and TMT policy. Previously, I spent two years consulting at McKinsey, with a focus on the APAC region. I'm drawn to interesting problems, and data science provides a creative outlet where I can express myself through both mathematics and letters. Looking ahead, I aim to dedicate my '80,000 hours' to leveraging intelligent systems to create positive social impact, especially for the most vulnerable.
