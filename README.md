### Hi. 

I like symbols, both words and numbers. My research in language is driven by this curiosity in how language shapes human experience. 

I earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Liberal Arts & Sciences from Quest University (British Columbia), with a focus on mathematics and critical theory.

Currently, I serve as a Senior Researcher in NLP R&D,(and implementation,) and TMT policy. Before that, I consulted at McKinsey for 2 years. Both focused on the APAC.
